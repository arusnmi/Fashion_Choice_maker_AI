# Fashion_Choice_maker_AI



This repository contains my AI fashion recommender



# Problem statement

the problem with current fashion recommender is that mst of them have a finite selection of random fashion options that are prompted when giving a sugestion and it usualy is nt good. The way it is done normaly is that there is a database of random diffrent outfit choices, and when prompted for a choice, it reads the keywords from the text and then gives a list of sugestions to the user. this lead to it being finite and taking a lot of resources to not make it finite. the only other soloution that i researched is that there could be physical assisastiants be there 24/7 to give fashion recmendations, but that thakes time and resources. 


# Inisights

During my research i actuly found a lot of models that are doing the same thing, where they use AI like machilne learning to make fasion choices, as the indrustery has recgnoized the problem already and is activly triying to fix it.
